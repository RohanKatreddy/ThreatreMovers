# TheatreMovers
A 3D-printed, moving theatre light for school events and community productions. This project was motivated by the lack of funding to buy professional intelligent lighting for our school theatre, which significantly limits creativity and flexibility during lighting design and general production.

# Demo
There is a demo video on this github page that was recorded during our very initial tests. Additionally, a video during the beginning stages of the high power lighting system is also included.
